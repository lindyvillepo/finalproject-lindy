Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3? Option 2

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
Movie class


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
The constructor will accept a dictionary that represents a movie.


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
An instance of this class will represent the movies title, director, rating, actors, and number of languages.


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
Three instance variables that this class will have is the movie's title, director, and IMDB rating. They will be called title, director, and rating. They're important because it makes movie instances unique from each other.


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
__str__ method.

- What will the method do?
Convert the information into a string.

- Will it take any additional input? 
No.

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return a string of the instances.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It's useful because it will put all instance variables together in a string.


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
list_of_actors method.

- What will the method do?
It will grab the list of actors from the movie, put the list into an instance variable, and return it.

- Will it take any additional input? 
No.

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return a list of actors from the movie, and it will change the actors instance variable.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It's useful because it will be easier to grab all the data of the actors from the movie and put them in a list.

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
The tables will be: Tweets, Users, and Movies.


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)
Tweets: Tweet ID (primary key), Tweet text, User who posted the tweet (referenced from the users table), The movie search the tweet came from (referenced from the movies table), Number of favorites, and Number of retweets.

Users: User ID (primary key), User screen name, Number of favorites the user has ever made, Text description of that tweet

Movies: Movie ID (primary key), Title of the movie, Director of the movie, Number of languages the movie has, IMDB rating of the movie, Top billed (first in the list) actor in the movie

* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")
-I want to make a query that accesses the text of the Tweet, and the director of the movie in the Tweet -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Movies table.
-I also want to make a query that accesses the screen name of all the Users.

* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
I'm planning to use counters and set comprehension.

* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
-Counter: I'm going to look for the most common words in the tweets, so I'm going to use a counter to find the top 3 words that are used.
-Set Comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for all the hashtags in the tweets, so I'm going to use a set comprehension to do that.

* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
It's going to be written onto a .txt file and will contain a summary of the stats: the three movie titles with Twitter summary of each movie.
