And, finally, write that data to a text file -- a sort of "summary stats" page with a clear title, e.g. <List your 3 movie titles> + Twitter summary, <current date>  or something, and have each result of your data processing clearly written to the file neatly below that, on several different lines.

-For my final project, I decided to do option 2.

-It grabs data from OMBD about four movies: high school musical, crazy, stupid, love, mean girls, we're the millers, and la la land. Then it sorts the data into movie instances, where it then takes the highest paying actor and searches twitter for popular tweets about the actor and all the users that are mentioned in these tweets.

-I created this project because you can search your favorite movies and see what people on Twitter are saying about the actors in the movies. You just need to input movies into a list that you would like to get data for.

-The program outputs data about the movie with an example tweet for each movie.

-It creates a database, finalproject.db

-You can run the file "206_final_proj.py" on a PC or terminal on a Mac

-It's dependencies include:
	-tweepy
	-sqlite3
	-requests
	-collections

-You have to have your own twitter_info.py to access the twitter API that contains your consumer key and access token.

-The only files you need to run this code is 206_final_proj.py and a twitter_info.py file.

-Functions
	-get_tweets(user_input): this function takes a string (user_input), and searches if it's already in the cache file. If it's not, it will search for data on Twitter and put it in the cache file. It will return a dictionary of twitter data found from either the cache file or Twitter.

	-get_movie_data(movie): this function takes a movie name (movie), and searches if it's already in the cache file. If it's not, it will search the OMDB website for information about the movie that was inputted. It will return a dictionary of movie data found from either the cache file or OMDB. 

	-list_of_tweet_tuples(tweet_diction, actor): this function takes in a tweetdictionary (found from the get_tweets function), and a search word (actor). It will iterate through the dictionary and find information about each tweet in the dictionary. It will then put all the information, including the search word, into a tuple about a specific tweet. Finally, it will put all the tweet tuples into a list of tuples and return it.

	-list_of_user_tuples(tweet_diction): this function takes in a tweet dictionary (found from the get_tweets function). It will iterate through the dictionary and find information about the user that posted each tweet, as well as information about users that were mentioned in the tweet. It will then put all the information about a user into a tuple. Finally, it will add all the tuples of user info into a list called user_list and return it.

	-get_twitter_hashtags(user_input): this function takes in a string (user_input), and searches if it has any hashtags in the string. If it does, it will return a set of them with the hashtag included.

-Classes
	-Movie class: The constructor of this class takes in a movie dictionary. It has 6 instances: id, title, director, languages, rating, and actors. It will find these instances in the movie dictionary. 

		-Method "list_of_actors": this method takes the movie dictionary and extracts the string of actors found and adds them to a list called actor_list. It will return this list and is used to find the instance "actors".

		-Method "num_languages": this method takes in the movie dictionary and extracts the string of languages found and adds it to the list language_list. It then finds the number of languages in the list and returns the number. This is used to find the "languages" instance.

		-The string method returns a string with the title, director, rating, and top paid actor.

-Databases
	-Users: the Users database has tables with the user id (primary key), screen name, number of favorites, and user description. Each row represents a user, and the tables show information about the user. 

	-Movies: the Movies database has tables with the movie id (primary key), movie title, director, number of languages, imbd rating, and top paid actor. Each row represents a movie, and the tables show information about the specific movie. 

	-Tweets: the Tweets database has tables with the tweet id (primary key), text of the tweet, number of favorites the tweet has, number of retweets, the screen name of the user who posted the tweet (referenced from the Users table), and the actor that was searched (referenced from the Movies table). Each row represents a tweet, and the tables show information about that specific tweet. 

-Data Manipulation
	-popular_users: this code outputs the twitter screenname (with the @ sign) of the most popular users (with retweets over 50) found from the Tweets database. It's useful because you can see who is well liked on Twitter and can possibly follow them. 

	-tweet_words: this code gives you all the words in popular tweets (ones with more than 25 favorites). This is useful because you can see what words people who get a lot of favorites use.

	-most_common: this code outputs the 3 most common words from the tweets that have more than 25 favorites. This is just cool to see what words mose people use.

	-twitter_actor: this code outputs the actor and the tweet associated with the actor. This is useful to see what people say about specific actors.

	-hashtag_set: this code outputs all the hashtags found in the popular tweets from before. This is useful to see what people who get a lot of favorites hashtag.

-I did this option because I thought it was the most interesting and applicable to people our age. It's cool to see what different tweets are about different actors from my favorite movies.
